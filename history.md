# History

## Early 2023

Started off as an idea. Wanted to make some sort of game, but no idea what.
Was also exploring a lot of game engines, primarily 2D ones, because 3D feels very out of reach for me.
Was also _very_ inspired from [PirateSoftware](https://www.twitch.tv/piratesoftware)'s encouragement to make games.

Around April 2023, I tried out Kontra, and made a small [proof of concept](https://github.com/altbdoor/today-i-learned/blob/master/topics/Tile-based%20movement%20in%20game%20with%20Kontra.md).
But its nothing more than moving a character in a small box. Shit's hard yo.

## May 2023

Around May 2023, I started using [Ren'Py](https://renpy.org/) as the main engine.
Mostly driven by the fact that I had experience with RenPy before, and I know Python somewhat.

I made [one build (version 0.2)](https://github.com/altbdoor/renpy-maget), but there was nothing much to it.
I now have the basic gameplay loop of the game, and also the theme surrounding it.
The idea was to have a "click here to grind", and "obtain X amount of gold in Y time".
It was basically parodying a moment when Magomet was grinding gold in Diablo 4.

I have ideas on featuring some old time chatters in the game, as interactive elements.
As an example, I thought of having an interactable bookshelf in the game, which would have books about chatters.
Like a book on investment from `buttermilkpancake`, or the likes.

## Late 2023

I started having a lot of real life issues, including health and my lodging.
I did not watch Magomet streams as much, and Magoment was also doing less variety game streams.
I pretty much gave up on the game silently.

## February 2024

[RPG Maker XP was released for free in Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/sale/RPGMaker2024).
I did grab a copy, and was sort of inspired to make a game with RMXP.
I was also somewhat getting my life back on track, so things are improving.

I still check out other 2D based engines, to have an idea of what is on the market now.
Pretty soon, I started a new RMXP project, and experimented with it.

I referred back to the old RenPy project as a base, and continued working on it.
I was able to quickly port over the base game mechanics from RenPy.

## March 2024

Had some discussions with the beta testers on the story. Continued to iterate and develop.
Announced in `psydekick`'s Twitch channel, that I am reworking the game in RMXP.

It has also been close to a year since the inception of the idea.

Lots of beta releases, and lots of beta testing.
At the end the month, the base game play mechanic was finalised, and polished.

## April 2024

A lot of final touch ups, including audio and graphics.

At this point, there were lots of good ideas on how to improve the gameplay loop,
but my main focus is to at least "finish the game".

On April 8, the [final beta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1zeEjKc6VY) was demonstrated on Twitch,
along with some minor fixes.

On April 10, the game was finalized, and zipped.
Magomet was informed about the game, and how its playable.

On April 22, the game was open sourced.
