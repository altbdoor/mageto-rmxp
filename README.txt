mageto
======

The open sourced version of "mageto" game, made with RMXP, and mkxp-z.

The audio bits can be a bit sketchy in legal terms, since I use lots of meme
audio clips, so they are hosted elsewhere.


## Setting up the project

> To note, I've developed and released the game only for Windows.

1. Get the latest mkxp-z ZIP build from the dev branch
   1. https://github.com/mkxp-z/mkxp-z/actions?query=branch%3Adev
1. Copy over the ZIP files to the project folder:
   1. `zlib1.dll`
   1. `x64-msvcrt-ruby310.dll`
   1. `mkxp-z.exe`, renamed to `Game.exe`
      - Mind the capitalisation!
1. Get the Audio package... elsewhere
1. Extract the Audio package
   1. To check, you should have `Audio/BGM/GMGSx.sf2`
1. Run `Game.exe` to play, or open `Game.rxproj` with RMXP to edit
